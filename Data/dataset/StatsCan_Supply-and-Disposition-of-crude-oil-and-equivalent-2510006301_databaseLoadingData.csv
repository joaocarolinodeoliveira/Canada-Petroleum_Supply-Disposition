1,"Changes have been made to the content and methodology of the Monthly Supply and Disposition of Crude Oil and Equivalent. These new changes have resulted in the creation of table 25-10-0063. Consequently, the information in this table is no longer directly comparable with information that was previously made available in table 25-10-0014. This historical table will remain available for historical revisions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
